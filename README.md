# Measuring the Stellar Mass of Large Magellanic Cloud and Milky Way Sized Galaxies

## Abstract
This thesis will explore an approach to measuring the cumulative star formation history (SFH) of galaxies with sizes comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Milky Way (MW), and their satellites. The stellar mass threshold for LMCs will be set as 1.00 × 10^9 - 1.00 × 10^10 M⊙, and 1.00 × 10^10 - 1.00 × 10^11 M⊙ for MWs. The historic and current stellar masses that will be used to determine the cumulative SFH will be provided by the Shin-Uchuu simulation. This high-resolution simulation allows for the ultra faint dwarf (UFD) satellite galaxies to be included in the study. The Universe Machine (UM) model will be utilized in order to track the accretion of dark matter, which in turn tracks baryonic matter and leads to the SFH over lookback time. 10,000 random samples of the cumulative SFH will be taken and 1,000 will be plotted for all analogs and satellites. Satellites will be categorized into two types: classicals, which have a stellar mass of 1.00 × 10^5 - 1.00 × 10^7 M⊙, and UFDs, which have a stellar mass of 1.00 × 10^5 M⊙ and below. These results will show that star formation generally increases over lookback time for these analogs.
